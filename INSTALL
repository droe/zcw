This document covers the installation procedure for zcw.


Compiling
---------

Edit the Makefile if needed (install path...).

Type "make tld" to update the TLD include files (needs to
be done before compiling). This operation can take up to
one minute or two...

Type "make cache" and "make sqlite" in this directory to
compile zcw with support for caching into a sqlite db
(much faster). You need to have sqlite version 3.x installed
in order for zcw to compile with this feature enabled.

# Sqlite is a simple network/passwordless database system.
# More infos on sqlite : http://www.sqlite.org/
#
# Compile sqlite3 with configure options : --disable-tcl --enable-tempstore
# A script (create_db.sh) will also download parts (less than
# 1 Mb) of the ARIN database to your computer (ARIN_cache.db).
#
# or easier :
#
# debian/ubuntu : apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev bc
# redhat/centos : yum install sqlite sqlite-devel
#

Type "make mta" to compile the sqlite / mta version

Type "make sqlite-spam" to compile the sqlite version optimized for spam reports
It should work, but it might give worst results than the classic version in some cases

Type "make classic" in this directory to compile the classic
version of zcw (ie: no cache).

Type "make server" in this directory to compile the
server version of zcw (to make a whois server).
The server needs the sqlite3 library and binaries to run.
Don't forget to chown nobody the folder in which you have
the sqlite databases installed. Default path is:
/usr/local/share/zcw

Then type "make install" (as root) and "rehash" if you use
a *sh shell.

To use zcw, simply type "zcw" and follow the
instructions...


Compiling Issues
----------------

 + ZCW should work under any *nix with a recent gcc
   (version 2.9x or newer (3.x/4.x)).

 + Getting other errors...

Requirements   
------------

To build zcw, you need : g++, grep, sed, cat, tr, uname, strip,
xargs, awk, tr, wc, wget, etc...
To build tcpserver (make server), you need : wget, tar, head,
tail, patch.
To build zcw with cache, you need : sqlite 3.x
Don't forget to install binaries, includes and library if you
are using packages (ie: lib*, *-devel or *-dev, *-bin in pkg name)
